* Tactic-Style Proofs
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Tactic-Style_Proofs
:END:

In this chapter, we describe an alternative approach to constructing
proofs, using /tactics/. A proof term is a representation of a
mathematical proof; tactics are commands, or instructions, that
describe how to build such a proof. Informally, we might begin a
mathematical proof by saying "to prove the forward direction, unfold
the definition, apply the previous lemma, and simplify." Just as these
are instructions that tell the reader how to find the relevant proof,
tactics are instructions that tell Lean how to construct a proof term.
They naturally support an incremental style of writing proofs, in
which users decompose a proof and work on goals one step at a time.

We will describe proofs that consist of sequences of tactics as
"tactic-style" proofs, to contrast with the ways of writing proof
terms we have seen so far, which we will call "term-style"
proofs. Each style has its own advantages and disadvantages. One
important difference is that term-style proofs are elaborated
globally, and information gathered from one part of a term can be used
to fill in implicit information in another part of the term. In
contrast, tactics apply locally, and are narrowly focused on a single
subgoal in the proof.

** Entering the Tactic Mode

Conceptually, stating a theorem or introducing a =have= statement
creates a goal, namely, the goal of constructing a term with the
expected type. For example, the following creates the goal of
constructing a term of type =p ∧ q ∧ p=, in a context with constants
=p q : Prop=, =Hp : p= and =Hq : q=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (Hp : p) (Hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
sorry
#+END_SRC
We can write this goal as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
p : Prop, q : Prop, Hp : p, Hq : q ⊢ p ∧ q ∧ p
#+END_SRC
Indeed, if you replace the "sorry" by an underscore in the example
above, Lean will report that it is exactly this goal that has been
left unsolved.

Ordinarily, we meet such a goal by writing an explicit term. But
wherever a term is expected, Lean allows us to insert instead a =begin
... end= block, followed by a sequence of commands, separated by
commas. We can prove the theorem above in that way:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
-- BEGIN
theorem test (p q : Prop) (Hp : p) (Hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
begin
  apply and.intro,
  exact Hp,
  apply and.intro,
  exact Hq,
  exact Hp
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
The =apply= tactic applies an expression, viewed as denoting a
function with zero or more arguments. It unifies the conclusion with
the expression in the current goal, and creates new goals for the
remaining arguments, provided that no later arguments depend on
them. In the example above, the command =apply and.intro= yields two
subgoals:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
p : Prop,
q : Prop,
Hp : p,
Hq : q
⊢ p

⊢ q ∧ p
#+END_SRC
For brevity, Lean only displays the context for the first goal, which
is the one addressed by the next tactic command. The first goal is met
with the command =exact Hp=. The =exact= command is just a variant of
=apply= which signals that the expression given should fill the goal
exactly. It is good form to use it in a tactic proof, since its
failure signals that something has gone wrong; but otherwise =apply=
would work just as well.

You can see the resulting proof term with =print=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (Hp : p) (Hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
begin
  apply and.intro,
  exact Hp,
  apply and.intro,
  exact Hq,
  exact Hp
end

-- BEGIN
reveal test
print test
-- END
#+END_SRC

You can write a tactic script incrementally. If you run Lean on an
incomplete tactic proof bracketed by =begin= and =end=, the system
reports all the unsolved goals that remain. If you are running Lean
with its Emacs interface, you can see this information by putting your
cursor on the =end= symbol, which should be underlined. In the Emacs
interface, there is another extremely useful trick: if you put your
cursor on a line of a tactic proof and press "C-c C-g", Lean will show
you the goal that remains at the end of the line.

Tactic commands can take compound expressions, not just single
identifiers. The following is a shorter version of the preceding
proof:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
-- BEGIN
theorem test (p q : Prop) (Hp : p) (Hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
begin
  apply (and.intro Hp),
  exact (and.intro Hq Hp)
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
Unsurprisingly, it produces exactly the same proof term.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (Hp : p) (Hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
begin
  apply (and.intro Hp),
  exact (and.intro Hq Hp)
end

-- BEGIN
reveal test
print test
-- END
#+END_SRC

Tactic applications can also be concatenated with a
semicolon. Formally speaking, there is only one (compound) step in the
following proof:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (Hp : p) (Hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
begin
  apply (and.intro Hp); exact (and.intro Hq Hp)
end
#+END_SRC

Whenever a proof term is expected, instead of using a =begin...end=
block, you can write the =by= keyword followed by a single tactic:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (Hp : p) (Hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
by apply (and.intro Hp); exact (and.intro Hq Hp)
#+END_SRC
In the Lean Emacs mode, if you put your cursor on the "b" in "by" and
press "C-c C-g", Lean shows you the goal that the tactic is supposed
to meet.

** Basic Tactics

In addition to =apply= and =exact=, another useful tactic is =intro=,
which introduces a hypothesis. What follows is an example of an
identity from propositional logic that we proved in Section [[file:03_Propositions_and_Proofs.org#Examples_of_Propositional_Validities][Examples of Propositional Validities]], but now prove using tactics. We adopt the
following convention regarding indentation: whenever a tactic
introduces one or more additional subgoals, we indent another two
spaces, until the additional subgoals are deleted.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ (q ∨ r) ↔ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) :=
begin
  apply iff.intro,
    intro H,
    apply (or.elim (and.elim_right H)),
      intro Hq,
      apply or.intro_left,
      apply and.intro,
        exact (and.elim_left H),
      exact Hq,
    intro Hr,
    apply or.intro_right,
    apply and.intro,
    exact (and.elim_left H),
    exact Hr,
  intro H,
  apply (or.elim H),
    intro Hpq,
    apply and.intro,
      exact (and.elim_left Hpq),
    apply or.intro_left,
    exact (and.elim_right Hpq),
  intro Hpr,
  apply and.intro,
    exact (and.elim_left Hpr),
  apply or.intro_right,
  exact (and.elim_right Hpr)
end
#+END_SRC

The =intro= command can more generally be used to introduce a variable of any type:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (A : Type) : A → A :=
begin
  intro a,
  exact a
end

example (A : Type) : ∀ x : A, x = x :=
begin
  intro x,
  exact eq.refl x
end
#+END_SRC
It has a plural form, =intros=, which takes a list of names.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example : ∀ a b c : nat, a = b → a = c → c = b :=
begin
  intros [a, b, c, H1, H2],
  exact eq.trans (eq.symm H2) H1
end
#+END_SRC
The =intros= command can also be used without any arguments, in which
case, it chooses names and introduces as many variables as it can. We
will see an example of this in a moment.

The =assumption= tactic looks through the assumptions in context of the
current goal, and if there is one matching the conclusion, it applies
it.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

variables x y z w : ℕ

-- BEGIN
example (H1 : x = y) (H2 : y = z) (H3 : z = w) : x = w :=
begin
  apply (eq.trans H1),
  apply (eq.trans H2),
  assumption   -- applied H3
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
It will unify metavariables in the conclusion if necessary:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

variables x y z w : ℕ

-- BEGIN
example (H1 : x = y) (H2 : y = z) (H3 : z = w) : x = w :=
begin
  apply eq.trans,
  assumption,     -- solves x = ?b with H1
  apply eq.trans,
  assumption,     -- solves ?b = w with H2
  assumption      -- solves z = w with H3
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
The following example uses the =intros= command to introduce the three
variables and two hypotheses automatically:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example : ∀ a b c : nat, a = b → a = c → c = b :=
begin
  intros,
  apply eq.trans,
  apply eq.symm,
  assumption,
  assumption
end
#+END_SRC
The =repeat= combinator can be used to simplify the last two lines:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example : ∀ a b c : nat, a = b → a = c → c = b :=
begin
  intros,
  apply eq.trans,
  apply eq.symm,
  repeat assumption
end
#+END_SRC

There is variant of =apply= called =fapply= that is more aggressive in
creating new subgoals for arguments. Here is an example of how it is
used:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

example : ∃ a : ℕ, a = a :=
begin
  fapply exists.intro,
  exact nat.zero,
  apply rfl
end
#+END_SRC
The command =fapply exists.intro= creates two goals. The first is to
provide a natural number, =a=, and the second is to prove that =a =
a=. Notice that the second goal depends on the first; solving the
first goal instantiates a metavariable in the second.

Notice also that we could not write =exact 0= in the proof above,
because =0= is a numeral that is coerced to a natural number. In the
context of a tactic proof, expressions are elaborated "locally,"
before being sent to the tactic command. When the tactic command is
being processed, Lean does not have enough information to determine
that =0= needs to be coerced. We can get around that by stating the
type explicitly:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

-- BEGIN
example : ∃ a : ℕ, a = a :=
begin
  fapply exists.intro,
  exact (0 : ℕ),
  apply rfl
end
-- END
#+END_SRC

Another tactic that is sometimes useful is the =generalize= tactic,
which is, in a sense, an inverse to =intro=.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

variables x y z : ℕ

example : x = x :=
begin
  generalize x, -- goal is x : ℕ ⊢ ∀ (x : ℕ), x = x
  intro y,      -- goal is x y : ℕ ⊢ y = y
  apply rfl
end

example (H : x = y) : y = x :=
begin
  generalize H, -- goal is x y : ℕ, H : x = y ⊢ y = x
  intro H1,     -- goal is x y : ℕ, H H1 : x = y ⊢ y = x
  apply (eq.symm H1)
end
#+END_SRC
In the first example above, the =generalize= tactic generalizes the
conclusion over the variable =x=, turning the goal into a =∀=. In the
second, it generalizes the goal over the hypothesis =H=, putting the
antecedent explicitly into the goal. We generalize any term, not just
variables:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

variables x y z : ℕ

-- BEGIN
example : x + y + z = x + y + z :=
begin
  generalize (x + y + z), -- goal is x y z : ℕ ⊢ ∀ (x : ℕ), x = x
  intro w,                -- goal is x y z w : ℕ ⊢ w = w
  apply rfl
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
Notice that once we generalize over =x + y + z=, the variables =x y
z : ℕ= in the context become irrelevant. (The same is true of the
hypothesis =H= in the previous example.) The =clear= tactic throws away
elements of the context, when it is safe to do so:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

variables x y z : ℕ

-- BEGIN
example : x + y + z = x + y + z :=
begin
  generalize (x + y + z), -- goal is x y z : ℕ ⊢ ∀ (x : ℕ), x = x
  clear x, clear y, clear z,
  intro w,                -- goal is w : ℕ ⊢ w = w
  apply rfl
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
The =revert= tactic is a combination of =generalize= and =clear=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

variables x y z w : ℕ

-- BEGIN
example : x = x :=
begin
  revert x,     -- goal is ⊢ ∀ (x : ℕ), x = x
  intro y,      -- goal is y : ℕ ⊢ y = y
  apply rfl
end

example (H : x = y) : y = x :=
begin
  revert H,     -- goal is x y : ℕ ⊢ x = y → y = x
  intro H1,     -- goal is x y : ℕ, H1 : x = y ⊢ y = x
  apply (eq.symm H1)
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
Like =intro=, the tactics =generalize=, =clear=, and =revert= have
plural forms. For example, we could have written above:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

variables x y z : ℕ

-- BEGIN
example : x + y + z = x + y + z :=
begin
  generalize (x + y + z), -- goal is x y z : ℕ ⊢ ∀ (x : ℕ), x = x
  clears x y z,
  intro w,                -- goal is w : ℕ ⊢ w = w
  apply rfl
end
-- END
#+END_SRC

# Probably unnecessary, when we describe the induction tactic:
#
# The =generalize= and =revert= tactics are often useful when carrying
# out proofs by induction, when it is often needed to obtain
# the right induction hypothesis.

** Managing Auxiliary Facts

Recall from Section [[file:08_Building_Theories_and_Proofs.org::#Making_Auxiliary_Facts_Visible][Making Auxiliary Facts Visible]] that we need to use
=assert= instead of =have= to state auxiliary subgoals if we wish to
use them in tactic proofs. For example, the following proofs fail, if
we replace any =assert= by a =have=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (p q : Prop) (H : p ∧ q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
assert Hp : p, from and.left H,
assert Hq : q, from and.right H,
begin
  apply (and.intro Hp),
  apply (and.intro Hq),
  exact Hp
end

example (p q : Prop) (H : p ∧ q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
assert Hp : p, from and.left H,
assert Hq : q, from and.right H,
begin
  apply and.intro,
  assumption,
  apply and.intro,
  repeat assumption
end
#+END_SRC
Alternatively, we can explicitly put a =have= statement into the
context with the keyword =using=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (p q : Prop) (H : p ∧ q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
have Hp : p, from and.left H,
have Hq : q, from and.right H,
show _, using Hp Hq,
begin
  apply and.intro,
  assumption,
  apply and.intro,
  repeat assumption
end
#+END_SRC

** Structuring Tactic Proofs

One thing that is nice about Lean's proof-writing syntax is that it is
possible to mix term-style and tactic-style proofs, and pass
between the two freely. For example, the tactics =apply= and =exact=
expect arbitrary terms, which you can write using =have=, =show=,
=obtains=, and so on. Conversely, when writing an arbitrary Lean term,
you can always invoke the tactic mode by inserting a =begin...end=
block. In the next example, we use =show= within a tactic block to
fulfill a goal by providing an explicit term.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ (q ∨ r) ↔ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) :=
begin
  apply iff.intro,
    intro H,
    apply (or.elim (and.elim_right H)),
      intro Hq,
      show (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r),
        from or.inl (and.intro (and.elim_left H) Hq),
    intro Hr,
    show (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r),
      from or.inr (and.intro (and.elim_left H) Hr),
  intro H,
  apply (or.elim H),
    intro Hpq,
    show p ∧ (q ∨ r), from
      and.intro
        (and.elim_left Hpq)
        (or.inl (and.elim_right Hpq)),
  intro Hpr,
  show p ∧ (q ∨ r), from
    and.intro
      (and.elim_left Hpr)
      (or.inr (and.elim_right Hpr))
end
#+END_SRC

You can also use nested =begin= / =end= pairs within a =begin...end=
block.  In the nested block, Lean focuses on the first goal, and
generates an error if it has not been fully solved at the end of the
block. This can be helpful in making the number of subgoals introduced
by a tactic manifest, and indicating when each subgoal is completed.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ (q ∨ r) ↔ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) :=
begin
  apply iff.intro,
  begin
    intro H,
    apply (or.elim (and.elim_right H)),
      intro Hq,
      show (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r),
        from or.inl (and.intro (and.elim_left H) Hq),
    intro Hr,
    show (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r),
      from or.inr (and.intro (and.elim_left H) Hr),
  end,
  begin
    intro H,
    apply (or.elim H),
    begin
      intro Hpq,
      show p ∧ (q ∨ r), from
        and.intro
          (and.elim_left Hpq)
          (or.inl (and.elim_right Hpq)),
    end,
    begin
      intro Hpr,
      show p ∧ (q ∨ r), from
        and.intro
          (and.elim_left Hpr)
          (or.inr (and.elim_right Hpr))
    end
  end
end
#+END_SRC
Notice that you still need to use a comma after a =begin...end=
block when there are remaining goals to be discharged. Within a
=begin...end= block, you can abbreviate nested occurrences of
=begin= and =end= with curly braces:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ (q ∨ r) ↔ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) :=
begin
  apply iff.intro,
  { intro H,
    apply (or.elim (and.elim_right H)),
    { intro Hq,
      apply or.intro_left,
      apply and.intro,
      { exact (and.elim_left H) },
      { exact Hq }},
    { intro Hr,
      apply or.intro_right,
      apply and.intro,
      { exact (and.elim_left H)},
      { exact Hr }}},
  { intro H,
    apply (or.elim H),
    { intro Hpq,
      apply and.intro,
      { exact (and.elim_left Hpq) },
      { apply or.intro_left,
        exact (and.elim_right Hpq) }},
    { intro Hpr,
      apply and.intro,
      { exact (and.elim_left Hpr)},
      { apply or.intro_right,
          exact (and.elim_right Hpr) }}}
end
#+END_SRC
Here we have adopted the convention that whenever a tactic increases
the number of goals to be solved, the tactics that solve each
subsequent goal are enclosed in braces. This may not increase
readability much, but it does help clarify the structure of the proof.

There is a =have= construct for tactic-style proofs that is similar to
the one for term-style proofs. In the proof below, the first =have=
creates the subgoal =Hp : p=. The =from= clause solves it, and after
that =Hp= is available to subsequent tactics. The example illustrates
that you can also use another =begin...end= block, or a =by= clause,
to prove a subgoal introduced by =have=.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
-- BEGIN
variables p q : Prop

example : p ∧ q ↔ q ∧ p :=
begin
  apply iff.intro,
  begin
    intro H,
    have Hp : p, from and.left H,
    have Hq : q, from and.right H,
    apply and.intro,
    repeat assumption
  end,
  begin
    intro H,
    have Hp : p,
      begin
        apply and.right,
        apply H
      end,
    have Hq : q, by apply and.left; exact H,
    apply (and.intro Hp Hq)
  end
end
-- END
#+END_SRC

** Cases and Pattern Matching

The =cases= tactic works on elements of an inductively defined
type. It does what the name suggests: it decomposes an element of an
inductive type according to each of the possible constructors, and
leaves a goal for each case. Note that the following example also uses
the =revert= tactic to move the hypothesis into the conclusion of the
goal.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

example (x : ℕ) (H : x ≠ 0) : succ (pred x) = x :=
begin
  revert H,
  cases x,
  -- first goal: ⊢ 0 ≠ 0 → succ (pred 0) = 0
  { intro H1,
    apply (absurd rfl H1)},
  -- second goal: ⊢ succ a ≠ 0 → succ (pred (succ a)) = succ a
  { intro H1,
    apply rfl}
end
#+END_SRC
The name of the =cases= tactic is particularly well suited to use with disjunctions:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (a b : Prop) : a ∨ b → b ∨ a :=
begin
  intro H,
  cases H with [Ha, Hb],
  { exact or.inr Ha },
  { exact or.inl Hb }
end
#+END_SRC
In the next example, we rely on the decidability of equality for the
natural numbers to carry out another proof by cases:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

check nat.sub_self

example (m n : nat) : m - n = 0 ∨ m ≠ n :=
begin
  cases (decidable.em (m = n)) with [Heq, Hne],
  { apply eq.subst Heq,
    exact or.inl (nat.sub_self m)},
  { apply or.inr Hne }
end
#+END_SRC
The =cases= tactic can also be used to extract the arguments of a
constructor, even for an inductive type like =and=, for which there is
only one constructor.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∧ q → q ∧ p :=
begin
  intro H,
  cases H with [H1, H2],
  apply and.intro,
  exact H2,
  exact H1
end
#+END_SRC
Here the =with= clause names the two arguments to the constructor. If
you omit it, Lean will choose a name for you. If there are multiple
constructors with arguments, you can provide =cases= with a list of
all the names, arranged sequentially:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

inductive foo : Type :=
| bar1 : ℕ → ℕ → foo
| bar2 : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → foo

definition silly (x : foo) : ℕ :=
begin
  cases x with [a, b, c, d, e],
  exact b,    -- a, b, c are in the context
  exact e     -- d, e    are in the context
end
#+END_SRC

You can also use pattern matching in a tactic block. With
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ q ↔ q ∧ p :=
begin
  apply iff.intro,
  { intro H,
    match H with
    |  and.intro H₁ H₂ := by apply and.intro; repeat assumption
    end },
  { intro H,
    match H with
    | and.intro H₁ H₂ := by apply and.intro; repeat assumption
    end },
end
#+END_SRC
With pattern matching, the first and third examples in this section
could be written as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat
open nat

inductive foo : Type :=
| bar1 : ℕ → ℕ → foo
| bar2 : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → foo

-- BEGIN
example (x : ℕ) (H : x ≠ 0) : succ (pred x) = x :=
begin
  revert H,
  match x with
  | 0      := by intro H1; exact (absurd rfl H1)
  | succ y := by intro H1; apply rfl
  end
end

definition silly (x : foo) : ℕ :=
begin
  match x with
  | foo.bar1 a b   := b
  | foo.bar2 c d e := e
  end
end
-- END
#+END_SRC

** The Rewrite Tactic

The =rewrite= tactic provide a basic mechanism for applying
substitutions to goals and hypotheses, providing a convenient and
efficient way of working with equality. This tactic is loosely based
on the rewrite tactic available in the proof language SSReflect.

# TODO: add a citation

The =rewrite= tactic has many features. The most basic form of the
tactic is =rewrite t=, where =t= is a term which conclusion is an
equality. In the following example, we use this basic form to rewrite
the goal using a hypothesis.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open nat
variables (f : nat → nat) (k : nat)

example (H₁ : f 0 = 0) (H₂ : k = 0) : f k = 0 :=
begin
  rewrite H₂, -- replace k with 0
  rewrite H₁  -- replace f 0 with 0

In the example above, the first =rewrite= tactic replaces =k= with =0=
in the goal =f k = 0=.  Then, the second =rewrite= replace =f 0= with
=0=. The =rewrite= tactic automatically closes any goal of
the form =t = t=.

Multiple rewrites can be combined using the notation =rewrite [t_1,
..., t_n]=, which is just shorthand for =rewrite t_1, ..., rewrite
t_n=.  The previous example can be written as:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open nat
variables (f : nat → nat) (k : nat)

example (H₁ : f 0 = 0) (H₂ : k = 0) : f k = 0 :=
begin
  rewrite [H₂, H₁]
end
#+END_SRC

By default, the =rewrite= tactic uses an equation in the forward
direction, matching the left-hand side with an expression, and
replacing it with the right-hand side. The notation =-t= can be used
to instruct the tactic to use the equality =t= in the reverse
direction.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open nat
variables (f : nat → nat) (a b : nat)

example (H₁ : a = b) (H₂ : f a = 0) : f b = 0 :=
begin
  rewrite [-H₁, H₂]
end
#+END_SRC
In this example, the term =-H₁= instructs the =rewriter= to replace
=b= with =a=.

The notation =*t= instructs the rewriter to apply the rewrite =t= zero
or more times, while the notation =+t= instructs the rewriter to use
it at least once. Note that rewriting with =*t= never fails.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat

example (x y : nat) : (x + y) * (x + y) = x * x + y * x + x * y + y * y :=

#+END_SRC

To avoid non-termination, the =rewriter= tactic has a limit on the
maximum number of iterations performed by rewriting steps of the form
=*t= and =+t=. For example, without this limit, the tactic =rewrite
*add.comm= would make Lean diverge on any goal that contains a
sub-term of the form =t + s= since commutativity would be always
applicable. The limit can be modified by setting the option
=rewriter.max_iter=.

The notation =rewrite n t=, where =n=, is a positive number indicates
that =t= must be applied exactly =n= times. Similarly, =rewrite n>t=
is notation for at most =n= times.

A pattern =p= can be optionally provided to a rewriting step =t= using
the notation ={p}t= .  It allows us to specify where the rewrite
should be applied. This feature is particularly useful for rewrite
rules such as commutativity =a + b = b + a= which may be applied to
many different sub-terms. A pattern may contain placeholders. In the
following example, the pattern =b + _= instructs the =rewrite= tactic
to apply commutativity to the first term that matches =b + _=, where
=_= can be matched with an arbitrary term.

example (a b c : nat) : a + b + c = a + c + b :=
begin
  rewrite [add.assoc, {b + _}add.comm, -add.assoc]
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
In the example above, the first step rewrites =a + b + c= to =a + (b +
c)=.  Then, ={b + _}add.comm= applies commutativity to the term =b +
c=. Without the pattern ={b + _}=, the tactic would instead rewrite
=a + (b + c)= to =(b + c) + a=.  Finally, =-add.assoc= applies
associativity in the "reverse direction" rewriting =a + (c + b)= to
=a + c + b=.

By default, the tactic affects only the goal. The notation =t at H=
applies the rewrite =t= at hypothesis =H=.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat

example (H : a + 0 = 0) : f a = f 0 :=
begin
  rewrite [add_zero at H, H]
end
-- END
#+END_SRC
The first step, =add_zero at H=, rewrites the hypothesis =(H : a + 0 = 0)=
to =a = 0=. Then the new hypothesis =(H : a = 0)= is used to rewrite the
goal to =f 0 = f 0=.

Multiple hypotheses can be specified in the same =at= clause.

end
-- END
#+END_SRC
You may also use =t at *= to indicate that all hypotheses and the goal should
be rewritten using =t=. The tactic step fails if none of them can be rewritten.
The notation =t at * ⊢= applies =t= to all hypotheses. You can enter
the symbol =⊢= by typing =\|-=.

end
-- END
#+END_SRC
The step =add_zero at *= rewrites the hypotheses =H₁=, =H₂= and the main goal
using the =add_zero (x : nat) : x + 0 = x=, producing =a = 0=, =b = 0= and
=a + b = 0= respectively.

The =rewrite= tactic is not restricted to propositions. In the
following example, we use =rewrite H at v= to rewrite the hypothesis
=v : vector A n= to =v : vector A 0=.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.examples.vector

Given a rewrite =(t : l = r)=, the tactic =rewrite t= by default
locates a sub-term =s= which matches the left-hand-side =l=, and then
replaces all occurrences of =s= with the corresponding
right-hand-side. The notation =at {i_1, ..., i_k}= can be used to
restrict which occurrences of the sub-term =s= are replaced. For
example, =rewrite t at {1, 3}= specifies that only the first and third
occurrences should be replaced.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.nat

by rewrite [H₁ at {1, 3}, H₂]
-- END
#+END_SRC
Similarly, =rewrite t at H {1, 3}= specifies that =t= must be applied
to hypothesis =H= and only the first and third occurrences must be
replaced. You can also specify which occurrences should not be
replaced using the notation =rewrite t at -{i_1, ..., i_k}=. Here is
the previous example using this feature.

So far, we have used theorems and hypotheses as rewriting rules. In
these cases, the term =t= is just an identifier.  The notation
=rewrite (t)= can be used to provide an arbitrary term =t= as a
rewriting rule.

#+END_SRC
In the example above, the term =mul_one a⁻¹= has type =a⁻¹ * 1 = a⁻¹=.
Thus, the rewrite step =-(mul_one a⁻¹)= replaces =a⁻¹= with =a⁻¹ * 1=.

Calculational proofs and the rewrite tactic can be used together.

The =rewrite= tactic also supports reduction steps: =↑f=, =▸*=, =↓t=,
and =▸t=.  The step =↑f= unfolds =f= and performs beta/iota reduction
and simplify projections.  This step fails if there is no =f= to be
unfolded. The step =▸*= is similar to =↑f=, but does not take a
constant to unfold as argument, therefore it never fails.  The fold
step =↓t= unfolds the head symbol of =t=, then search for the result
in the goal (or a given hypothesis), and replaces any match with
=t=. Finally, =▸t= tries to reduce the goal (or a given hypothesis) to
=t=, and fails if it is not convertible to =t=.  (The up arrow is
entered with =\u=, the down arrow is entered with =\d=, and the right
triangle is entered with =\t=. You can also use the ASCII alternatives
=^f=, =>*=, =<d t=, and => t= for =↑f=, =▸*=, =↓t=, and =▸t=,
respectively.)

The step =↑double at H1= unfolds =double= in the hypothesis =H1=.
The notation =rewrite ↑[f_1, ..., f_n]= is shorthand for
=rewrite [↑f_1, ..., ↑f_n]=

The tactic =esimp= is a shorthand for =rewrite ▸*=. Here are two simple examples:

Here is another example: given any type =A=, we show that the =list A=
append operation =s ++ t= is associative.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import data.list
open list
variable {A : Type}

theorem append_assoc : ∀ (s t u : list A), s ++ t ++ u = s ++ (t ++ u)
| append_assoc nil t u      := by apply rfl
| append_assoc (a :: l) t u :=
  begin
    rewrite ▸ a :: (l ++ t ++ u) = _,
    rewrite append_assoc
  end
#+END_SRC
We discharge the inductive cases using the =rewrite= tactic. The base
case is solved by applying reflexivity, because =nil ++ t ++ u= and
=nil ++ (t ++ u)= are definitionally equal. In the inductive step, we
first reduce the goal =a :: s ++ t ++ u = a :: s ++ (t ++ u)= to =a ::
(s ++ t ++ u) = a :: s ++ (t ++ u)= by applying the reduction step =▸
a :: (l ++ t ++ u) = _=.  The idea is to expose the term =l ++ t ++
u=, which can be rewritten using the inductive hypothesis
=append_assoc (s t u : list A) : s ++ t ++ u = s ++ (t ++ u)=. Notice
that we used a placeholder =_= in the right-hand-side of this
reduction step; this placeholder is unified with the right-hand-side
of the main goal. As a result, we do not have the copy the right-hand
side of the goal.

The =rewrite= tactic supports type classes. In the following example
we use theorems from the =mul_zero_class= and =add_monoid= classes in
an example for the =comm_ring= class. The rewrite is acceptable
because every =comm_ring= (commutative ring) is an instance of the
classes =mul_zero_class= and =add_monoid=.
